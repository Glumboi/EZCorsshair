# EZCorsshair
LITTLE DISCLAIMER
=================
It could be that in some games with an anti cheat that you could get banned (which i doubt but safety first) i also 
dont support anyone using this as a cheat in games
that dont display a crosshair please be a fair player!
======================================================

Basic info
==========
EZCrosshair was an app that i made for fun, personal and learning use but i decided to release it now.
Currently it is not that good looking and also not that good functioning but i gonna release a couple updates ofc 
ones i learned more about how crosshair apps work.

Currently it displays a form which is either 2 by 2, 5 by 5 or 10 by 10 pixels. Later on i want to also include real crosshairs but at the moment
i focus on making it display in most games in borderless fullscreen since it only works in a couple games and ONLY in borderless fullscreen.
=============================================================================
How to use:
Just open the app and setup your crosshairs look (size and color) and then press the draw button if you want to change you settings press hide
and change you settings after that pres draw again and i should change.

HAVE FUN USING IT!
==================

Changelog
=========
V 0.5:
-First version of the app that is mostly finished 
-Updated the GUI so i can release it
-Added different color settings
